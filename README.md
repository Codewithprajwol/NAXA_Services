# NAXA Services - Frontend Application

 This is a React application I built it showing the NAXA's services. It also includes a newsletter subscription form, and shows office location on a map.

## What This App Does

- Shows all the services NAXA offers with nice cards and descriptions
- Has a cool hero section with background image
- Displays an interactive map showing NAXA's office location
- Newsletter subscription section for updates
- Fully responsive - works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Smooth scroll-to-top button when you scroll down

## Tech Stack

I used these technologies:

- **React 19** with **TypeScript** - For building the UI
- **Vite** - Super fast build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling (no custom CSS files!)
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** - Fetching data from API
- **Leaflet & React-Leaflet** - Interactive maps
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
- **Axios** - Making API calls
